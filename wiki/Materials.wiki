#summary Guide to writing renderer materials.

= Introduction to Materials =

Creation of JavaScript based material libraries for YPlatform's renderer is explained in this short guide.


= Details =

Material libraries reside in *materials/* folder either packaged or in *homeDir* and have *.js* extension.
Each material can have multiple *stages* - textures so to speak, which are manipulated via *textureMods*, *alphaGens*, *colourGens* and *blendModes*.
Materials are updated via *update()* function which is called with 50 FPS.

* Syntax* (keywords)
  * Material is constructed in the following way:
    * _var foo = new material( mtrName )_
  *Stage can be initialized in multiple ways:
    * _var bar = new stage( texture, material, (clampMode))_
    * _var bar = new stage( texture, (clampMode))_
    * _material.stage( stageNum )_ - creates/returns stage automatically as long as *stageNum* is not larger than total number of stages plus 1.
      * _setBlendMode( src, dst )_ - "one", "zero"
      * _setBlendMode( keyword )_ - e.g. "add", "blend"
      * _setColourGen( type, args, .. )_ - e.g. ( "const", 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 )
      * _setAlphaGen( type, args, .. )_ - e.g. "const" or "func" ( "sine", "square", etc.)
      * _setTextureMod( type, args, .. )_ - e.g. "scale", "rotate"
  * _milliseconds()_ - returns current platform time.
  * _print( msg )_ - prints message to console.
  * _cvar( cvarName )_ - returns value of a cvar

To see the rest, undocumented features, check *r_mtrlib.cpp* and *r_materialstage.h* for public slots.
